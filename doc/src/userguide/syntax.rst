Syntax
======

This part of the documentation explains the syntax of valid SpeedCrunch input. As you will see, SpeedCrunch honors most conventions for mathematical expressions. You will find using SpeedCrunch to be very natural and intuitive, especially so if you are already familiar with a programming language.


Number Notation
---------------

Decimal Form
++++++++++++

When you would like to specify a non-integer value, simply enter the number as you would write it on paper,
with either a period (``.``) or a comma (``,``) as the decimal separator. By default, these can be
used interchangeably, i.e. both ``1.234`` and ``1,234`` represent the same number. However, this
behavior can be changed; see :ref:`Radix Character <radix_character>` for more information.

Trailing zeros after the decimal point (like in ``12.300``) or leading zeros before it (``0012.3``) are redundant and can be included or omitted to the user's preference. Expressions like ``.5`` as a shorthand notation for ``0.5`` are also permitted.

.. _digit_grouping_separators:

Digit Grouping Separators
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To improve readability, SpeedCrunch accepts grouping separators inside number literals. Grouping separators are optional and ignored during evaluation.

Allowed grouping separators are characters that are **not** letters or digits and are **not** number operators. In practice, this includes many punctuation and symbol characters, for example:

* ``_`` (underscore): ``12_345_678``
* Space: ``12 345 678``
* ``·`` or ``٬``: ``12·345·678`` and ``12٬345٬678``
* Currency symbols: ``$12,345``, ``€12 345``, ``12¥345``

Not allowed as grouping separators:

* Letters from any language (for example ``天``, ``é``, ``Ж``)
* Digits from any language
* Radix characters (``.`` or ``,`` depending on settings) when they are used as decimal separators
* Operator characters and other reserved syntax tokens

Some characters cannot be used for digit grouping because they already have an assigned meaning in expressions:

* ``#`` starts hexadecimal number notation (for example ``#FF``).
* ``!`` is the factorial operator (for example ``5!``).
* ``:`` is used in sexagesimal time/angle notation (for example ``12:34:56``).
* ``°`` is used in sexagesimal angle notation (for example ``12°34'56``).
* ``'`` is used in sexagesimal time/angle notation (for example ``12°34'56``).
* ``&`` is the bitwise AND operator (for example ``6 & 3``).
* ``?`` starts a comment (for example ``1+2 ? note``).

Examples:

* ``12$345.678$9`` evaluates as ``12345.6789``
* ``12天2`` is rejected (it is **not** treated as ``122``)


.. _scientific_notation:

Scientific Notation
+++++++++++++++++++

When dealing with very small or very large numbers (think the size of an atom or of a galaxy) the notation above is inconvenient. These are more commonly expressed in scientific notation; for instance, 1.234*10\ :sup:`-9` is preferable to 0.000000001234.

Naturally, in SpeedCrunch this could be written as ``1.234*10^-9``, but there's also a shorthand notation: ``1.234e-9``. Here, the ``e`` represents ``*10^``, but it is considered a part of the number literal and treated with higher precedence. For example, ``1e2^3`` is equivalent to ``(1e2)^3 = 100^3``. The scale of a number (sometimes called its exponent) always begins with the scale character ``E`` or ``e`` followed by a signed integer. So ``e+10``, ``e-4``, ``E-0`` are all valid scale expressions. If the sign is '+', you may simply omit it: ``e0``, ``E10``. The significand (i.e. the part preceding the exponent) is required; exactly one exponent must be specified.

Compared to most calculators, SpeedCrunch can accept very large numbers without overflowing (e.g. both ``1e+536870911`` and ``1e-536870911`` are still valid). However, only about 78 significant digits are stored at any point. Any digits beyond that are lost.

Non-Decimal Bases
+++++++++++++++++

In addition to decimal (base-10) numbers, SpeedCrunch provides support for binary (base-2), octal (base-8) and hexadecimal (base-16) numbers.
You can enter a number in any of these bases by marking it with the corresponding prefix:

* ``0b`` or ``0B`` for **binary**, e.g. ``0b10010``.
* ``0o`` or ``0O`` for **octal**, e.g. ``0o1412``.
* ``0d`` or ``0D`` for **decimal**. These can be omitted since decimal is the default base.
* ``0x``, ``0X``, or ``#`` for **hexadecimal**. The additional six digits are represented by the upper or lower case letters ``a`` to ``f``, e.g. ``0xdeadbeef`` or ``0xDEADBEEF``.

You may even enter fractional values in any of these bases. Note that scientific notation is not
supported for non-decimal bases, however. Examples::

    0b1.01
    = 1.25

    0xf.a
    = 15.625

To have SpeedCrunch output its results in a base other than decimal, you may use one of the functions :func:`bin`, :func:`oct`, :func:`dec`, or :func:`hex`::

    hex(12341)
    = 0x3035

The effect of these functions only applies to the immediate result and doesn't carry to future
operations::

    0x2 * hex(12341)
    = 24682

For assembly-style fixed-width formatting, use :func:`binpad`, :func:`octpad`, or :func:`hexpad`.
These functions only accept real, dimensionless integer arguments and also only affect the immediate result::

    hexpad(15)
    = 0x0F

    binpad(1536; 32)
    = 0b00000000000000000000011000000000

To change the base that is used for displaying results, select one of the corresponding settings in :menuselection:`Settings --> Results --> Format`.

SpeedCrunch stores integers with a precision of up to 256 bits. Since this would be unwieldy,
the binary representation of a negative number in SpeedCrunch is *not* its two's complement.
Instead, like with other bases, the value and the sign are represented separately::

    bin(-1)
    = -0b1

See :func:`mask` and :func:`unmask` to convert a negative number into the two's complement form.

Any integer larger than the 256-bit limit will be silently converted into a floating point number, making it susceptible to rounding errors.
To specify large integers, using the shift operators (``1 << n``) is preferable to exponentiation (``2 ^ n``) as the latter are floating point
calculations and thus susceptible to rounding errors.


.. _sexagesimal_values:

Sexagesimal Values
++++++++++++++++++

    .. versionadded:: 1.0

Sexagesimal values in SpeedCrunch are angle degrees or time values represented with minutes and seconds.

When sexagesimal mode is selected in :menuselection:`Settings --> Results --> Format`, dimensionless and time results are displayed as sexagesimal values. All other results are displayed as fixed-point decimal values. Actual sexagesimal math depends on the result. Dimensionless results are handled as degrees with minutes and seconds generated from the decimal part. With time dimension results, base unit is second and the integer part is divided to minutes and hours.

In input, characters ``°`` (degree), ``:`` (colon), ``'`` (single quote) and ``"`` (double quote) can be used for entering sexagesimal values. Degree sign ``°`` separates degrees and minutes. First colon character ``:`` separates hours and minutes. Single quote ``'`` or second colon character ``:`` separates minutes and seconds. Additionally, postfix double quote ``"`` can be used as an arc second unit. Because the degree sign is difficult to produce from keyboard, at sign ``@`` is automatically converted to it.

Amount of minutes or seconds is not limited to values below 60. It is possible to input time 90 minutes after noon::

    12:90
    = 13:30:00
    
Dimensionless input values are automatically considered to be in current angle units. For example, in radian mode::

    pi
    = 180°00'00
    
Only last part of sexagesimal input value can contain decimals.

Following tables show some possible input notations and their results in both fixed-point decimal and sexagesimal modes.
In the first table, fixed-point decimal values assume angle unit is set to degrees:

=================    ===================    =================

Note that when entering time values with colons, no additional dimension units are needed. Formatting itself works as an unit.

Comments
--------

The question mark character ``?`` starts a comment. Everything from ``?`` to the end of the line is ignored by the evaluator::

    1 + 2 ? simple sum
    = 3

A line can also be comment-only. If the first non-space character is ``?``, the whole line is treated as a comment::

    ? start algorithm

      ? this is also a comment-only line

Operators and Precedence
------------------------

When writing an expression like ``10+5*4``, which operation will be executed first? The common rules of operator precedence tell us that in this case multipication shall be computed first, hence the result is ``30``. We also distinguish **unary** operators (which act on a single number/operand) and **binary** operators (which link two operands).

SpeedCrunch supports the following operators, listed in order of decreasing precedence:

For negative bases in *real mode*, the exponentiation rule can be read as:

1. Express the exponent as a reduced rational ``p/q``.
2. If ``q`` is even, the result is ``NaN``.
3. If ``q`` is odd, the result is real, with sign set by ``p``:
   odd ``p`` gives a negative result, even ``p`` gives a positive result.

Examples::

    (-13)^(1/3) = -2.3513346877207574895
    (-13)^(2/3) = 5.5287748136788717828
    (-13)^(1/9.123) = 1.32465488702830785593
    (-13)^(1/2) = NaN
    (-13)^pi = NaN
